## Running
The game can be played by simply opening the .jar file.

## Tasks
### Part1 (20 Marks)
   1.  The game begins with an appropriate well-designed welcome message.
  
   2.  Your application simulates the dice roll operation for both players.
  
   3.  Computer generates 3 random numbers between 1-6 (simulating a 6 sided dice), for each player.
  
   4.  The players’ scores are updated every time dice roll button clicked for each player.
  
   5.  If it generates a pair, then the player score is the sum of that pair. For example if it generates 3 & 3 & 1, the player         scores will be the sum of 3 & 3 which is 6.
  
   6.  If all the 3 dice rolls have the same values, then the score will be 18.
  
   7.  Otherwise, for any other combination, they just get 1 score.
  
   8.  If both players reaches a score which is more than the pre-defined maximum, the game’s result is a Draw
  
   9.  A player is considered a winner if he/she accumulates a score which is more than the predefined maximum.
  
   10. At every state of the game, both players’ score must be displayed together with the name of the player who is leading the game.

### Part 2 (20 Marks)

   11. Using JavaFX, develop a basic GUI to simulate the above listed functionalities.

### Part 3 (40 Marks)

   12. Your application should display the state of each player (the scores and highlights if they are heading) every time the dice is rolled.
   13. Your application should have the proper user instruction to explain the game and its rules; such as a short clip or animation
   14. Your application needs to have at least 3 different layout managers.
   15. You are encouraged to propose and implement new features different from the above listed items including extra visual features, animation. You can gather ideas by looking at similar applications. You are expected to consider the usability principles and produce an application that takes good care of them.
   16. Your source code should be well organised and documented. 

### Part 4 (20 Marks)

   17. A document discussing the importance of usability principles in designing software user interfaces and how these principles were approached in the development of your software application. Therefore, choose and discuss any three design principles from the following link that apply to your application.
